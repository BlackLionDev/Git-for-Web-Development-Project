Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

	Answer: Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that inline-block 		allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, with display: inline, top 	and bottom margins & paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block 	they are.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?

	Answer: absolutely positioned elements are taken out of the flow and positioned 	relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (that is not static).

	Answer: this can be accomplished with CSS Flex

	Answer: <p> <div> and <nav> are all block. <a> <img> <span> are all inline. <img> 	is also inline-block.
